## Our Philosophy

We help you integrate with your shipping carriers and improve your fulfilment processes without loosing control.

We believe that the logistics industry can greatly benefit from a unified, open and standardized shipping API that gives you direct access to a network of carriers, control over customers' personal data and **compliance**.

## What are the benefits?

Karrio is the only **product-focused** open-source shipping platform with label generation, customs documentation generation and package tracking API that **you can host on your own infrastructure**.

We are an open-source alternative to manual in-house carrier integration and Multi-carrier Saas APIs. We're designed to be more **developer-friendly**, with the fullset of shipping functionalities without vendor-lockin.


**Shipping for enterprise**

Karrio makes modern shipping accessible to retailers as well as enterprises in regulated industries and government agencies.

**Shipping for platforms**

With Karrio, you can extend your platform with native shipping capabilities. Improve merchants and shippers and consumers experience on your Marketplace, eCommerce, ERP, WMS, OMS and apps.
